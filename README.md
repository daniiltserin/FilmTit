FilmTit
===

This is an old, unmaintained project that we made (in 6 people) for school assignment in 2012.

It was supposed to do translation memory + machine translation from a fixed pair of languages - English-to-Czech.

It's surprisingly still working here - http://ufallab.ms.mff.cuni.cz:12480/ - without being maintained whatsoever.

If you find something here helpful here, good for you. 

update (2016): it seems somehow maintained version is here - https://github.com/LordMathis/FilmTit (on other branches)
